1. INTRO: "This is my OS project - a system monitor"
2. PROBLEM: "Computers slow down when programs misbehave"
3. LIVE VIEW: "Watch real-time monitoring in action"
4. ALERTS: "It detects problems automatically" 
5. SAFETY: "Multiple layers prevent accidents"
6. NETWORK: "Basic security scanning included"
7. CONCLUSION: "Like a doctor for your computer!"

"Monitors your computer in real-time - tracking CPU, memory, and disk usage"

"Detects problems automatically - like memory leaks and suspicious processes"

"Shows historical trends - so you can see how your system performs over time"

"Includes safety features - to prevent accidentally breaking your system"

"Adds network security - by scanning for unusual open ports"

"Provides intelligent alerts - that explain what's wrong and suggest fixes"

"Helps understand OS concepts - by showing how processes and memory really work"
